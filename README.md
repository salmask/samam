## Long-Term Goals

Satyanveshana Mandali focuses on lifestyle and philosophy, aiming to provide comprehensive tools and resources to enhance various aspects of life.

### Lifestyle Tools

We plan to offer tools such as:
- Workout trackers
- Food trackers
- Healthy recipes
- Life goal trackers

We also support local groups called Satsangam, which are 54-week programs where members discuss topics like daily schedules and study improvements. Each Satsangam will have coordinators and members, with tools to create content and update syllabuses.

### Philosophy Tools

Our philosophical focus is on epistemology, aiming to develop digital tools that facilitate better and clearer thinking practices.

## Join Us!

We invite developers and thinkers passionate about lifestyle enhancement and philosophical inquiry to contribute to our project. Your contributions will help us build a platform that empowers individuals to lead healthier, more thoughtful lives. Together, we can create tools that make a real difference!
